# 🏠💡 **House Price Prediction using XGBoost**

This project demonstrates how **XGBoost**, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, can be used to predict house prices using the **Boston Housing Dataset**. Compared to traditional models like **Linear Regression**, XGBoost offers better performance and flexibility in capturing complex patterns.

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the **median value of owner-occupied homes** in Boston suburbs based on various economic and structural features.  
We compare the performance of **XGBoost** against **Linear Regression** to demonstrate why boosting models often outperform linear ones.

## 📊 **Why XGBoost?**

**XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** is a highly efficient and scalable machine learning algorithm, optimized for speed and performance.  

### 🚀 **Advantages over Linear Regression:**
- ✅ Captures **non-linear relationships** between features and target
- ✅ Handles **missing values** automatically
- ✅ Reduces **overfitting** through **regularization**
- ✅ Supports **parallel computation** for faster training
- ✅ More accurate on **tabular datasets** like housing data

### 🆚 **Linear Regression Limitations:**
- ❌ Assumes a **linear** relationship
- ❌ Sensitive to **outliers**
- ❌ Cannot automatically handle feature interactions
